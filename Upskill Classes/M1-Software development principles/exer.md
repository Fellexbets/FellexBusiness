         Example string : 'dog'
         Expected Output : d,do,dog,o,og,g

  28. Write a function that returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order.
         Example string : 'webmaster'
         Expected Output : 'abeemrstw'
         Assume punctuation and numbers symbols are not included in the passed string.

  29. Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case.
         Example string : 'the quick brown fox'
         Expected Output : 'The Quick Brown Fox '

  30. Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string.
         Example string : 'Web Development Tutorial'
         Expected Output : 'Development'

  31. Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string.
         Note : As the letter 'y' can be regarded as both a vowel and a consonant, we do not count 'y' as vowel here.
         Example string : 'The quick brown fox'
         Expected Output : 5

  32. Write a function that accepts a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.
         Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

  33. Write a function which will take an array of numbers stored and find the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively.
         Sample array : [1,2,3,4,5]
         Expected Output : 2,4

  34. Write a function which says whether a number is perfect.
         According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
         Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.

  35. Write a function to convert an amount to coins.
         Sample function : amountTocoins(46, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1])
         Here 46 is the amount. and 25, 10, 5, 2, 1 are coins.
         Output : 25, 10, 10, 1

  36. Write a function to get the number of occurrences of each letter in specified string.

  37. Write a function to extract unique characters from a string.
         Example string : "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
         Expected Output : "thequickbrownfxjmpsvlazydg"

  38. Write a function that returns array elements larger than a number.

  39. Write a function to find the first not repeated character. Go to the editor
         Sample arguments : 'abacddbec'
         Expected output : 'e'

  40. Write a function to apply Bubble Sort algorithm.
         Note : According to wikipedia "Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order".
         Sample array : [12, 345, 4, 546, 122, 84, 98, 64, 9, 1, 3223, 455, 23, 234, 213]
         Expected output : [3223, 546, 455, 345, 234, 213, 122, 98, 84, 64, 23, 12, 9, 4, 1]

  41. Write a function that accept a list of country names as input and returns the longest country name as output.
         Sample function : Longest_Country_Name(["Australia", "Germany", "United States of America"])
         Expected output : "United States of America"

  42. Write a function to find longest substring in a given a string without repeating characters.
