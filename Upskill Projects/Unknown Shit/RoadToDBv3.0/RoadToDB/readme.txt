*** Welcome to the nightmarish Road To Database! ***
****************************************************

	Challenges:

		0. Does it work? What does it do?
		1. Study the solution and projects. Identify what does what! Comment the code at your will.
		2. Consider the other six db models. What do you need to integrate them in the solution? Check if you can get it done.
		3. Add a Find option in the menu that receives an ID and shows the selected entity only.
		4. Find any bugs and document them. If you can, correct them and document the solution.
		5. Consider some topics highlighted in the comments, study and summarize them (hint: Reflection, Enumeration).
		6. If you needed to change the JSON files location, how many times would you modify the path? Suggest a correction for this issue.
		7. Questions:
			a) Console: How do we write in color?
			b) How to map db models to json files? Explain how it is done.
			c) To integrate other db models, do you need to modify the manager?
			d) What is the purpose of the ICrud interface and IHasPrimaryKey interface? How are the used?
			e) Is there a difference between "Operation" and "Entity"? What do those concepts mean?
			f) Why do we need "newOfT" in the Manager?
			g) What is the purpose of the "new()" restriction on the top?
			h) Why do we need IEnumerable<T> implementation in the Manager?
			i) Is "Entity" really needed? What was its purpose?
			j) What is the usefulness of singleton design pattern in the Manager?
			k) Is the path attribute the only way of solving the path issue? Suggest an alternative.
